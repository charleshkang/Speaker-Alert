Speaker Alert is a speech timing application inspired by Toastmasters and designed for all occasions: work presentations, club meetings, stand up comedy spots or even that all important wedding speech.

You get alerts at 4 times during your speech. Green for your minimum time, Amber for when you're approaching the end, Red for when you need to be finishing up and a flashing alert if you really should be off stage.

Just select a timing profile, hit Start and put your device down in front of you for clear and bright visual alerts, or pop it in your pocket for vibrating alerts.

Choose from a comprehensive collection of speech profiles, or create your own! Group profiles to keep everything organized.

"I love the new features. I have been using 3 different timer apps to get all the features I wanted. Now it is just yours." - Rodney Grady, DTM
