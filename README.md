# Speaker Alert

Speaker Alert is a simple iPhone app for timing speeches, based on the Toastmasters "Traffic Light" model.

Elapsed time is displayed in the centre of the main view, and the background of the app changes at set times: Green for the target speech time, Amber approaching the maximum time, and Red when the maximum time has been used.

Vibration alerts are also given when the lights change.

## What's New

Version 2.0 will add support for watchOS 2, along with the option of using pre-set timings.
